-----  future project to mess with and learn AI and Machine learning and strengthen python skills -----

# WrenchWise

**A machine learning tool for predicting automotive repair cost categories based on vehicle data.**

---

## Overview

RepairScope is a Python-based machine learning project that uses historical automotive data to predict whether a vehicle repair will fall into a **low**, **medium**, or **high** cost category. 

The project is designed to help service advisors, shop owners, or even customers get a quick estimate range based on key attributes like **make, model, year, mileage, and issue type**.

## Goals

- Use `pandas` and `scikit-learn` for data cleaning and model training.
- Build a predictive model using classification (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest).
- Make the tool expandable with user-uploaded CSVs or JSON data in future versions.
